# Getting Started

## Structure

- `spring-boot` - Spring Boot application that acts as a resource server
- `nextjs` - Next.js application that acts as a client `src/main/frontend`

## Prerequisites

- Create Clerk Account and add a new application to get the API Keys (You can go to Developers -> API Keys section to
  retrieve the keys)
- Setup Webhook URL in Clerk (You can go to Configure -> Webhooks section to add a new webhook URL)
- You should use Ngrok to expose your local server to the internet to test the webhook URL

### Environment Variables

1. Spring boot (rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and add the values)

- `WEBHOOK_SECRET` - The secret key that you have set in the webhook URL in Clerk
- `JWKS_URL` - The JWKS URL that you can get from the API Keys section in Clerk

2. Next.js (rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and add the values)

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - The publishable key that you have set in the API Keys section in Clerk
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - The secret key that you have set in the API Keys section in Clerk
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` default value is `/sign-in`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL` default value is `/sign-up`
- `API_URL` - The URL of the Spring Boot application (you should use the URL generated by ngrok)

## Running the application

- Start the Spring Boot application: `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (should be setup environment variables first)
- Run ngrok to expose the Spring Boot application to the internet: `ngrok http 8080` (or use static domain)
- Start the Next.js application: `npm run dev`
